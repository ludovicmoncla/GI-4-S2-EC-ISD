## Overview

The objective of this lab is to analyze and model the Vélo'v bike-sharing dataset from Lyon, France. The dataset contains historical data on bike availability at various stations throughout the city.
The lab is structured into three main parts, each focusing on different aspects of data science relevant to Industrial Engineering:

1. Data Exploration, Cleaning & Enrichment (Data Engineering & Visualization)
2. Clustering (Unsupervised Learning & Segmentation)
3. Regression & Forecasting (Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics)


## Session 1 - Data Exploration, Cleaning & Enrichment

* Date: February 4, 2026, 14:00 - 18:00
* Room: Thorgal

[See session1.md for details](session1.md)


## Session 2 - Clustering & Segmentation

* Date: February 10, 2026, 8:00 - 12:00
* Room: Flash Gordon

## Session 3 - Regression & Forecasting

* Date: February 11, 2026, 14:00 - 18:00
* Room: Flash Gordon
